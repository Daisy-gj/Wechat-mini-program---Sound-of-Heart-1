# Wechat-mini-program---Sound-of-Heart
A social mini program prototype with the aim of mind relief. In this mini program, moments are strictly categorized by several 1st-level tags and 2nd-level tags. After posting moments, users finish a questionaire. With enough number of questionaires, users can check a genral report for their states of mind. Users can also find moments with similar tags from other users and interact with them. Interactions like repost, comments and likes from others users can also show to current users.
